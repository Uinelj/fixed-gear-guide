## Comments

### State 4130

Don't take anything from the Core line, as the frame is Hi-Ten.

### Aventon Cordoba

Aventon has had QA issues, keep that in mind.

### Polo and Bike CMNDR

Sloping top tube can make the bike uncomfortable to ride and tires are horrific.

### Fuji Feather

Feathers are renewed each year with only new colors/colorschemes: try to get a last years' one as it will be the same but cheaper.

### Santafixie Raval/Born

No idea about the quality of these ones, but they seem cheap for CroMo frames.
