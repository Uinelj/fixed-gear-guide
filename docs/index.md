# Fixed gear buying guide

This guide is heavily inspired (or downright copied from the users' suggestions) by the [r/fixedgearbicycle](https://reddit.com/r/fixedgearbicycle) subreddit. The subreddit's guides are becoming stale/old, and this guide is a effort to build something more updatable and reliable that enables everyone to contribute.  

You can contribute via:
- pull requests if you know how they work
- opening an issue and letting someone who knows to do a pull request
- TODO: find a document-like way of contributing
