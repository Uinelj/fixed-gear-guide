# Fixed gear buying guide

## hi!
This guide is heavily inspired (or downright copied from the users' suggestions) by the [r/fixedgearbicycle](https://reddit.com/r/fixedgearbicycle) subreddit. The subreddit's guides are becoming stale/old, and this guide is a effort to build something more updatable and reliable that enables everyone to contribute.  

The aim is to provide an easy to access guide with bikes sorted by region and price range.
